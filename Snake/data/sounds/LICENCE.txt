HELLO THERE!
Well I know you hate reading long formular documents, so I kept it simple.
Every sound except of the debugsound is made by me (tom_wuba), and is free to use, tho it would be an hornor if you would mention me, if you're using
it in whatever way. This project is just for fun, so obviously there's no copyright or sth on this stuff, but still, please be aware, that I've put a lot
of effort into it so please threat those files nicely :D

anyways, enjoy playing/listening
